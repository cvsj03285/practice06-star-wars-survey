# Guided Project - star-wars-survey

We'll practice visualizing the data with bar plot and grouped bar plot, we can easily realize the correlation or 
difference when looking at plots. Lwt's start below!

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) became interested in 
answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: <b>does the rest of America realize</b> 
<b>that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?</b>

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using 
the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which you download from [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).

The data has several columns, including:
- RespondentID - An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)
- Gender - The respondent's gender
- Age - The respondent's age
- Household Income - The respondent's income
- Education - The respondent's education level
- Location (Census Region) - The respondent's location
- Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise? - Has a `Yes` or `No` response
- Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise? - Has a `Yes` or `No` response
